        "1) Root Folder Structure\n"
        "   • Choose a ROOT folder that contains one folder per PATIENT.\n"
        "   • Inside each patient folder, there may be multiple subfolders\n"
        "     (scan types / studies / plans).\n"
        "   • The program will automatically search all subfolders for:\n"
        "       - CT series      (DICOM with CT Image Storage UID)\n"
        "       - RT Dose files  (DICOM with RT Dose Storage UID)\n\n"
        "   Example:\n"
        "     MyData/\n"
        "       ├── P001/\n"
        "       │     ├── OriginalCT-Plan/\n"
        "       │     │      CT*.dcm\n"
        "       │     │      RTDOSE*.dcm\n"
        "       │     └── SynCT-Plan/\n"
        "       │            CT*.dcm\n"
        "       │            RTDOSE*.dcm\n"
        "       ├── P002/\n"
        "       │     ├── StudyA/\n"
        "       │     └── StudyB/\n"
        "       └── ...\n\n"
        "2) Workflow\n"
        "   • Click 'Load Patient Data' and select the ROOT folder.\n"
        "   • Choose a patient ID from the dropdown.\n"
        "   • Select two scan types (A = reference, B = evaluation).\n"
        "   • Use 'View Slices' to visually verify CT + dose overlay.\n"
        "   • Adjust gamma criteria if needed (2% / 2mm / 10% etc.).\n"
        "   • Click 'Calculate Gamma Index' to run 3D gamma.\n\n"
        "3) Outputs\n"
        "   • Gamma 3D array (.npy)\n"
        "   • Flattened gamma (.csv)\n"
        "   • Text summary (pass rate, criteria)\n"
        "   • Mid-slice gamma PNG image\n"
